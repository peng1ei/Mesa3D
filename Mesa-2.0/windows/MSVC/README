From Barry Roberts regarding updates for 1.2.8:

The makefiles are hand-modified from Roger Cottam's.  My Developer's
Studio GPF'ed trying to load them in once I had started hand
tweaking them.

I used MSVC 4.0 under Windows 95.  I haven't tried building release
mode libraries.

To create the makefiles for the other samples (spin, gears, shadow), I
copied the bounce makefile and did a global search and replace.  So the
dependencies are probably wrong.

Some of the demos still include tk.h which has been changed to gltk.h.
